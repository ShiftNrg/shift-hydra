		"title": "How is Shift different from older decentralized web technologies like Freenet, and what makes Shift better?",
		"content": "<p>The Freenet network and other older web decentralization technologies suffer inherent limitations to bandwidth and latency. For example, Freenet websites are therefore incapable of hosting dynamic content, and complex web technologies such as PHP and MySQL are impossible to use.</p><p>Shift is capable of serving dynamic content with performance that rivals or surpasses heavy servers. Shift also includes advanced capabilities for running an entire decentralized application ecosystem, not just the Phantom dApp, and Shift can deliver tokenized services with smart revenue models.</p>",

		"title": "How frequently does Shift push development updates from the private repository to its public GitHub?",
		"content": "<p>It really depends on the software that we’re working on. Our development method is as follows: first we start developing in a private repository. If the code is finished, then we start testing it ourselves in the private repository. If we think the code is working properly (stable enough), we then push our code to GitHub. Software will be released on testnet first. On testnet we ask our community members to help us test the product at its fullest. If necessary, we do some bug fixes. We’ll do a feedback round with our community members to see if we can improve something. If we’re satisfied with the end result, we then push the code to mainnet. In certain instances we may delay pushing code from the private repository to GitHub, in order to prevent competitor copying; but the code is open-source, and all of it is eventually made public in time intervals which allow us to preserve our competitive advantage of being farther ahead in development progress than our competitors.</p>",

		"title": "Why did it take months to create a new Shift website for the end of 2017?",
		"content": "<p>The new website itself didn’t take long to create. The development of the technology behind the hosting of the website took some time: because we wanted to give an example of the possibilities of decentralized hosting on our IPFS cluster, we hosted our new (dynamic) website on the cluster. Therefore, we had to develop a working prototype of the cluster first, along with custom decentralized database solutions. Thus the new Shift website is more than a website — it is a working proof of our flagship dApp, Phantom.</p>",

		"category": "About Shift",
		"title": "Can decentralized websites hosted through Shift be experienced on regular desktop and mobile web browsers?",
		"content": "<p>Yes, we have accomplished this by building an add-on for the IPFS daemon: a DNS monitor, called Jenga, monitors the health of the nodes inside the cluster and makes sure that the domains of the nodes always point to healthy servers. This procedure approaches a realization of decentralized domains without requiring the use of any third-party browser extensions: it is a clever way of bridging the old internet (DNS/http) with the new.</p>",

		"title": "In simple words, how does Shift avoid the scalability problems that hinder most blockchain technologies from efficiently delivering services and transactions in large volumes?",
		"content": "<p>We’re using delegated Proof-of-Stake (dPOS) as the consensus algorithm for our blockchain. In terms of power usage, dPOS is much more efficient than most consensus mechanisms (such as Proof-of-Work) since the block producers don’t compete for the longer chain. The calculations are also much easier to compute compared to the Bitcoin hash rate. Our delegates compute a hash from a certain input, while Bitcoin miners have to find an unknown value from a given output.</p><p>Lisk, which Shift was forked from, is working on the ability to process larger volumes of transactions. At the moment, 25 transactions per block can be hard coded. However, Lisk and Shift are designed to use sidechains as a scaling solution: this makes it possible for potentially unlimited tokenized services to run without compromising the speed or efficiency of the main chain.</p><p>Shift is also introducing a new consensus algorithm that will allow more delegate nodes to produce blocks, instead of the standard 101. We’re also in contact with the blockchain group from the TU Delft, which is aiming to redefine blockchain technology to make it scalable. We are thus constantly learning and endeavoring to stay on the cutting edge of blockchain scaling innovations.</p>",

While we are not legal experts regarding the requirements to be considered a security token by the SEC, we have studied the Conceptual Framework for Legal & Risk Assessment of Blockchain Crypto Property (BCP) published by the legal firm MME.* With this framework at hand, we have defined SHIFT as a BCP 1 infrastructure token (or utility token).</p><p>Shift meets the criteria for this classification because people will be able to use the token to pay for data storage or other services that will be provided on our platform. (Other examples of Infrastructure Tokens are Ether, IOTA, and Ripple.) Because of these classification attributes, we do not believe that the Shift token would qualify as a security in the eyes of the SEC. Shift’s current regulatory status and position is very strong, and we trust that the choices we have made so far will also serve us well when the market inevitably becomes more regulated.</p><a>*<a href='https://www.mme.ch/fileadmin/files/documents/Publikationen/170927_Magazinbeitrag_BCP_Genesis_Version.pdf'>Conceptual Framework for Legal & Risk Assessment of Blockchain Crypto Property (BCP)</a></p>",

		"content": "<p>While there are reasons to believe that peer-to-peer decentralized hosting with Shift will be cheaper than traditional hosting methods, at the moment we cannot guarantee that file hosting on our platform will be cheaper compared to these huge hosting services. Currently, in collaboration with a group of economic experts we’re developing a smart revenue model that should make it profitable for everyone to become a storage node without imbalancing Shift’s economy. Besides the importance of the technology behind our platform, the revenue model will be essential for Shift’s success.</p>",

		"content": "<p>We don’t think that millions of dollars are the key to success. There are many examples of projects out there with enormous funding, but they don’t seem to get things done. We believe it’s more important to have the right people on board. At the moment, we’re very happy with our team members, and we are continually attracting new and exciting talent to the team</p><p>We’re also aiming to implement a self-funding mechanism inspired by smart economics. The idea is that a fixed percentage of the inflation (forged SHIFT) automatically goes to our development and marketing wallet. These tokens will be used for reinvesting in the growth of the project and paying the salaries of key staff.</p>",

		"title": "Why is the Shift token useful?",
		"content": "<p>The Shift token is useful because it can be used to pay for hosting services and other services on our dApp platform. Our token can therefore be defined as a utility coin. As the total value of services rendered on the Shift network increases, the value of the Shift token also correspondingly increases since it is the medium of exchange whereby those services are rendered.</p>",

In our private repositories we’re really close to the goal of supporting sidechains. Syncing of the sidechain is stable now, which is quite an achievement on its own. The next step is having stable multi-forging.</p><p>We will also introduce atomic swaps in the future using IPLD (InterPlanetary Linked Data).</p>",

		"title": "Does Shift have inflation?",
		"content": "<p>Yes. The current inflation is 1.1 SHIFT per block (block reward). Our blocktime is 27 sec. So what is the supply increase per year?</p><p>3600 x 24 x 365 = 31536000 sec. per year. 31536000 / 27 sec. = 1168000 blocks per year. 1168000 x 1.1 SHIFT per block = 1,284,800 SHIFT per year (under the assumption that every block will be produced). However, this only describes inflation in the first year. The reward schema:</p><ul><li>1.1 Shift from block 828000</li><li>0.9 Shift 1 year later</li><li>0.7 Shift 2 years later</li><li>0.5 Shift 3 years later</li><li>0.3 Shift 4 years later</li></ul><p>The block rewards can be changed manually. We’re likely going to introduce dynamic fees (and dynamic block rewards) since this will be necessary for a proper revenue model for the storage nodes. (Lisk is also going to introduce dynamic fees.) So the reward schema will change in the future.</p>",

		"content": "<p>No, Shift tokens are not ‘burned’. However, Shift tokens will be ‘locked’ when they’re transferred to the side chain in order to provide or consume services, such as storage services through Phantom. The mechanism of token-locking disincentivizes dumping Shift tokens on the market, while tokens are exchanged for storage with the node owners (therefore not being burned).</p>",

		"title": "What are the ways in which the Shift token's value increases?",
		"content": "<p>The Shift token’s value is likely to increase because it will be used [as a utility coin] to pay for services on our platform. When using your tokens to pay for storage (for example), a certain amount of your tokens will be stored on Phantom’s sidechain and therefore will be locked. This causes a shortage of tokens at our main chain (and the exchanges). A shortage of tokens could mean a value increase at the exchanges.</p>",

		"title": "Can Shift be forked or cloned?",
		"content": "<p>Yes, Shift can be forked or cloned since our code is open source. It is very likely that our IPFS implementation will be forked by several projects at some point. That is why we start developing in private repositories. Doing so preserves our head start (thus we continue to be ahead of everyone else, especially our competitors). However, we’re not afraid of being forked or cloned. We are the original creators of Phantom, and shall continue to reap the benefits of a first-mover advantage in our niche. Furthermore, our creativity as the first innovators may continue to keep us ahead of the curve when it comes to expanding the Shift dApp ecosystem and improving the platform.</p><p>Besides that, it is our philosophy to decentralize the web. This can only be achieved by sharing technology with others to improve it. Open-source software is therefore a necessity. Many of our own achievements were made possible by using Lisk and IPFS code in the first place, as this enabled us to invest more energy in our own key innovations such as Phantom, Jenga, and Hydra.</p>",

The process of getting accepted has however gotten a lot more complex within the last year. One of the key reasons for this is to combat the rising amount of vaporware projects, as well as pump and dump schemes. Many exchanges frown upon speculative communication, and by doing so, we would potentially risk sabotaging any collaboration before it has even begun. To avoid this, we follow a very strict \"no comment\" policy in regards to price or exchange speculation.</p>",
