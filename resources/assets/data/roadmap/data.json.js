The Introductory White Paper itself will therefore consist of two parts: a technical part, and a part for a more casual consumer audience. Furthermore, the three other planned white papers will be introduced in more detail. This first white paper therefore has the purpose of producing material that is useful for introducing Shift to new investors, potential users, and new community members. This material is scheduled for release approximately a month after the release of the storage cluster to testnet."

This cannot be done without a backend. The explorer also uses caching, so it therefore needs a file system. At the moment, the backend is excessively intertwined with the frontend. This makes it difficult to have the socket client at IPFS and the socket server at the explorer nodes, such that it is therefore impossible to host the explorer on the cluster. If the explorer’s code is rewritten, hosting it on the cluster should be possible. The explorer will be the first example of an “in real-time” dynamic website that is truly decentralized, even though IPFS’ pubsub is still in development and not yet completed as an alternative to traditional websockets."
