        	"en": "<p>Have you ever seen the “John Wick” thriller films? Ralf strikes me as the John Wick of the crypto world: a man of few words, vast resourcefulness, and absolute resolve. Yes, it sounds a bit flippant. But I don’t know how to better describe what he’s like: I think he’s possessed by an almost lunatic determination to see Shift succeed, since there were obstacles in Shift’s earlier development that would have probably made any normal human give up. Ralf never gave up. </p><p> On the surface he’s an unassuming guy. He says he’s always spent most of his time behind a screen, beginning with his Commodore 64. He enjoys making electronic music, designing in Photoshop, and blockchain coding as creative outlets. </p><p> When Ralf read about Bitcoin for the first time, he felt immediately grabbed by the concept of a trustless mediation between buyers and sellers. He thought mostly about the technology itself, not trading; at the end of 2013, he invested a small amount in Bitcoin, but didn’t pay much attention to it until Ethereum showed up. This marked the emergence of smart blockchains: the igniting spark of Ralf’s passion to contribute his creative energy to the coming tech revolution. </p><p> In 2016, developers were requested on Bitcointalk.org to assist with coding the first Ethereum fork, which was trying to become a decentralized storage solution. Ralf liked the idea behind Shift a lot, applied to join its team, and went on to help build the backend and frontend, including a web wallet running on Zeronet. </p><p> At that time, Ethereum’s codebase could be easily abused by attackers with enough hashrate to perform a 51% attack. The project was eventually hit hard: some of the early investors, and devs’ friends, had their Shift wallets hacked. Thus this was a crisis for both the project, and the developers personally. The immediate reaction was to want to create a “Golden Block” of around one million new tokens for compensating the victims through a hard fork, as the Ethereum project had done in response to the infamous Dao hack. </p><p> However, the community didn’t support taking the easy way out. Generating new tokens to compensate victims would have devalued everyone else’s existing tokens through inflation. Ultimately, the team adhered to the community’s wishes, upholding the democratic spirit of a decentralized project. This was more important to Ralf, in particular, than avoiding personal losses. The team therefore ended up compensating the victims from its own fund. </p><p> Never cutting corners, and under such strains on his spirit and energy, Ralf nonetheless recognized then that a new platform called Lisk would be better suited than Ethereum for maximizing Shift’s security and its technological potential. Although Lisk was still young and not ready for adoption, Ralf’s team began porting Shift to a Lisk fork, and built a forging mainnet even before the Lisk project itself had done so. </p><p> I personally can’t imagine assuming the daunting task of a port after just passing through so much upheaval. Ralf wasn’t deterred by the challenges. After everything that had happened, Ralf still just cared about doing what was best for the project, like he always had. </p><p> Compensating victims of the hack from the project’s fund was the proper thing to do, but this move in turn led to further challenges for Shift as some developers demanded salaries that the project could no longer support. In one case, a former developer eventually left the project in August 2017 to create an ICO by forking Shift. This developer’s sudden departure caused roadmap release delays and also ironically instigated concerns that the Shift project, by association, was just a cash grab – despite that the ex-dev’s actions were in fact prompted by the team’s unwillingness to sell out their principles of democratic, community governance on one hand, and responsibility toward the victims of the hack, on the other hand. </p><p> With the project facing such external and internal strains, which started with the hack in 2016 and culminated in its aftermath a year later, August 2017 was a brutal time. The value of Shift, which had previously been in CoinMarketCap.com’s Top 100, plummeted. The remaining team members, who had continued upholding their integrity to the spirit of the project since the beginning, had been tested both morally and financially. </p><p> I asked Ralf to explain his decision back in August 2016 to port the project to Lisk, given the immensely demoralizing circumstances of that time. In his characteristic matter-of-factness, Ralf’s reply was movingly plain: “Even though the storage solution was functional, it wasn’t satisfying enough.” He added: “Moving from Zeronet to IPFS meant starting back from scratch. We continued and crawled back up to where we are now. It was a move we never regretted.” </p><p> I probed him to elaborate. Why did he care about Shift so much? He told me: “If I had left Shift last summer like the rest, I could have made a fortune elsewhere. But if you start a chain (in my case, join), then there’s a responsibility to do all you can to deliver the product. So one part is not letting down the team. The other is the interest/joy of accomplishing.” </p><p> Finally, I asked Ralf about the result he hoped for from his work. I was expecting him to talk about Shift changing the world. But Ralf’s answer was nothing so predictable. It simply expressed his focus and resolve, which I think probably stem from his ability to keep his eyes on the road, no matter how far or near his destination: “About the result: if the storage layer and blockchain are running stable, then we can start building upon that basis. So it’s not the end, but a beginning of the next chapter.” </p><p>In my opinion, Shift is going to show the world what can be achieved by combining the peerless resolve and human grit of Ralf’s team with great community passion. We also have benefited from standing on the shoulders of giants: Lisk and IPFS are fantastic open-source projects, and as Ralf points out, reusing their code has enabled us to build new tools like Phantom and Jenga without being too preoccupied in core-related development areas. All of the obstacles that the project faced in 2017 have been overcome; all of the 2017 release goals have been fulfilled. Shift has reached an unstoppable stage of momentum and maturity: the team has become stronger than ever, and Ralf is leading again in 2018, up to Shift’s completion as the first next-generation dApp platform with its own natively integrated “killer dApp” driving mass adoption. It’s going to be an incredible year and we are grateful to Ralf: for what lies behind us, and ahead.</p>"

			"en": "<p>Despite being a young prodigy in the field of chemistry, Heisenberg’s ambitions for knowledge and adventure have brought him into acquaintance with many disciplines, such as philosophy, politics, and social sciences, as well as numerous mentors: lawyers, philosophers, scholars, and naval officers, for example. He credits his mentors with honing his analytical and strategic faculties, and brings his own as well as others’ skills to the Shift project through his significant network within the Dutch intellectual world. </p><p> Heisenberg is also a major contributor to Shift in creative areas such as the script for our animated video, and the concept for a collaboration with university economists to determine optimal value parameters for Shift’s smart revenue model for the storage nodes. He’s therefore both a “man of words” and a “man of action,” in the phrasing of the American author Eric Hoffer – a rare combination which makes him exceptionally capable in the role of Operations Manager for Shift. </p><p> While Heisenberg says that his programming skills are not sufficient for making him a useful member of development team, nonetheless he sometimes also assists the team with conceptualizing innovations on the development side. When he’s not working on Shift, his time is spent working with a research group that uses computational chemistry (quantum-mechanical modelling) to simulate ruthenium water oxidation catalysts that catalyze the splitting of water in hydrogen and oxygen, for the purpose of advancing research into the use of hydrogen as a clean and sustainable energy source. </p><p> In summary, my impressions from working with Heisenberg are that he’s very, very smart. However, he’s also grounded: he can incise into the core of an issue or problem and immediately strip away the fluff. And although he’s got a no-nonsense attitude that sometimes appears curt, he’s a very principled and humane person in my experience. </p><p> I believe this side of him has its roots in his philosophical mindset, which reflects in how his conduct with the rest of the team is guided by very strong principles. He says his favorite philosophers are Kant, Hume, Sartre, Schopenhauer, and Aristotle. While his initial interest in crypto developed out of a broader fascination with cyber security, as a high school student one of his earliest passions was studying the Aristotelian logical system of syllogism. Heisenberg says this particular phase within his lifelong search for truth ended up circling back to crypto, as these “very basics of logic can be related to blockchain consensus: what is truth?” </p><p> Heisenberg has been helping Shift since 2016. He says he never tires of manning the helm, no matter how preoccupied Ralf is by development work. “Shift is a once in a lifetime experience,” Heisenberg once remarked, “so I’m all in.” I can speak for all of us in saying that Shift is very fortunate in having his ceaseless efforts and contributions, both toward the project and the team. </p>",

			"en": "<p>Before joining the Shift Team, Isabella was the chief system architect for Lisk, presiding over this aspect of its development from May 2016 until November 2017. Isabella helped grow Lisk into the amazing, successful open-source project that it is today: from a market cap of about thirty million dollars to a cap over two-and-a-half billion dollars, at the time of writing. </p><p> It is therefore no surprise that Isabella’s coding and analytical skills are absolutely first-rate. Before working on blockchains, her professional work history constituted an impressive showcase of upper-level corporate positions, covering a vast diversity of technical areas such as enterprise level systems engineering, database administration, and applications architecture. </p><p> Isabella says that over the past two years, her passion for creating new decentralization tech has only increased. She enjoys the challenge of being on the front line of novel implementations, but her personal values and ideology are the most combustive fuels to her fire for getting things done. At the same time, her work ethic is paced and methodical: she’s a long-distance runner, not a sprinter. Her devotion shines through in her commitment and endurance. </p><p> I was told by Isabella that after starting her work in blockchain with Lisk, she “signed on board to design the backend architecture and maintain their backend systems.” This, she says, “included running the entire set of Genesis Delegates and troubleshooting network-wide issues during the early days.” These experiences contributed significantly to her technical knowledge of blockchain and the challenges each technology faces. </p><p> “Through my work at Lisk,” she continued, “I learned what was truly important to me in the blockchain space: Transparency and Mutual Respect.” For Isabella, these are values that can be directly realized in how people interact and live in the context of technology that helps their lives: “I believe these two concepts are key in the space, not only from the devs to end users, but end users to other end users. Blockchain gives us a chance to all be equal to one another on the internet. It doesn't matter where you work or who your parents were, it just matters that you are there and trying your best to make the ecosystem better for everyone else.” </p><p> Hearing Isabella share her vision for blockchain (and by extension, the future of Shift) was frankly both exciting and inspiring: exciting, because I believe that her work with Shift will change the world; and inspiring, because I believe that her passion comes from a place that is altruistically pure, and we feel honored that she has placed her confidence in Shift as the right vehicle for actualizing her values in the world. As her colleagues, we are all looking forward to watching this vision unfold together in the time to come.</p>"

		"description": {
			"en": "<p>Craig is like a retro-futuristic midnight cowboy. His dry, self-aware humor gives the impression of an urban sophistication, but he exhibits none of the aloofness, the detachment, or the veneer of ironic scorn that speciate the hipsterized “homo modernus,” or in Pink Floyd’s glorious description, “lost souls swimming in a fish bowl, year after year.” Rather, Craig’s outward wit and quickness enshroud a modest, laid-back core, which he probably owes to his small town roots. In short, he’s wicked smart, but still the kind of guy that you’d want to have a beer with. </p><p> Although Craig had dabbled in programming since the age of twelve, he studied music technology at NYU – a passion which later found its outlet in his band, Space Command – and his first job was working at an ad agency on projects for clients like Scholastic, VEVO, and Nokia. After that, he left to work at Vimeo, where he developed extensive programming skills and eventually became a principal staff engineer. During this time he heavily contributed to Vimeo’s technology infrastructure, including their core application framework, video delivery mechanisms, CDN integrations, the video player, and many other things. Craig quit from Vimeo in March 2017. </p><p> He’d been part of the company’s growth from 20 to 200 employees, over the span of seven years. Craig says he felt that the corporatization of the company, while natural, didn’t leave him with as much of a voice at the end as he had in the early days, being in a team of 20. He felt himself open up to new possibilities when a friend’s words prompted a turning point: Craig had a sudden realization that if he left Vimeo, he’d be able to get another job any time he wanted – no problem. </p><p> Craig told me: “In terms of where I am right now, I don’t want to feel chained to a big corporation, so I am enjoying working on things I find interesting and teaching myself how to do new things,” whether for his music, for any one of the many open-source projects in his GitHub, or for Shift. Although Craig’s commitment to Shift is “technically part-time,” he puts an incredible amount of heart and soul into his work for the project and is no stranger to overtime when the development team is grappling with particularly challenging milestones. Sometimes Craig’s devotion makes the difference in a big way, with a breakthrough that feels like a game winning shot at the three-pointer line which has just beaten the buzzer. </p><p> I think the reason that Craig is so devoted to Shift is pretty simple: he is “really into the idea of a decentralized web.” Silicon Valley fandom notwithstanding (I learned from Craig that the idea the characters of the HBO show are working on shares similarities with Shift), he believes that Shift’s goals are important and offer a needed contribution to the world. “I have been getting frustrated with big companies like Facebook and Google and Amazon controlling a lot of the web infrastructure and the way the web works,” he told me, “and I love the idea of people being able to lend out their own servers to deliver content and get rewarded for it.” </p><p> When asked to elaborate why this matters to him, Craig explained: “I envision a world where in the future, as a developer, you will be able to instantly launch any site you want on a decentralized network with infinite scalability, and it will be global and faster than any traditional hosted solution available today.” Craig says he thinks “Shift may be able to help make that a reality” and that he was furthermore attracted to the fact that Shift “had a working proof-of-concept already running without ever having an ICO,” adding: “I think that is how things should work.” In other words, Craig holds to the ideal of putting the technology first over hype. In his opinion, “ICO crazes” and “Bitcoin fork crazes” could undermine what the technology can do for the world by misdirecting the crypto community’s focus away from that question. </p><p> Nevertheless, whatever its foibles, being involved in crypto “is very exciting” for Craig, and Shift’s ideal fit, to Craig’s personal interests and values, has made this revolution even more exciting: Craig fully believes that Shift “has the ability to take a chunk of the existing CDN market and cloud computing market, especially since it will be possible to use it with the existing internet infrastructure without requiring people to download a custom web browser.” This, he says, “is super important when it comes to adoption,” which is ultimately what he cares about most. </p><p> I’ll speak for all of the Shift community in expressing my belief that Craig, through this project, will achieve his cherished aspiration, one that we all share: we’re going to impact the world together. </p>",

			"en": "<p>Will believes that the art of living lies in these two life skills: being able to see what is needed, whether by other people or situations, and then being able to give it in the right way and time. He’s attempted to apply this life philosophy to his work in each phase of his professional development, e.g. as a student of cognitive sciences, as a graduate humanities scholar in Yale academia, and as an e-commerce professional in numerous successful startups. </p><p> Will sums up his entire personal outlook quite briefly: “I like cynical humor, but laughing at life isn’t as good as laughing with it. I don’t see that as a difference between pessimism and optimism, but as a difference between partial and full acceptance of what we experience. I think how we grow from things is up to us; the ultimate freedom is to allow no one else to decide the qualities of your heart, because that decides the course of your life. Many seem to imagine that passivity is harmony and convenience is contentment, but peace is not for the faint of heart.” </p><p> Bringing his extensive marketing and business development background to Shift is exciting for Will because he sees crypto as the great frontier of our age. “E-commerce is no longer the untamed frontier that it used to be,” he remarked, “whereas crypto may become a revolution that even dwarfs the societal impacts which the internet has had in the last two decades.” </p><p> Will also considers the goals of the Shift project to fall in alignment with his ideals about what technology should do for the world: “Interconnected-ness is an ethically neutral attribute of nature, and everything is interconnected. Sometimes this works to the welfare of individuals and communities, such as when they’re connected through charity, kindness, and mutual help. But the other aspect of interconnected-ness is the food chain: everything is feeding on everything else, because resources are finite and desires are not. Technology such as the internet amplifies our interconnected-ness and dials it up to eleven.” </p><p> This is why Will believes that the stakes in crypto are massive: “If this technology centralizes power, it will only consolidate power in ways that our ancestors never could have imagined, and if we extrapolate from history, this could become a catastrophe for the human race. On the other hand, if this technology decentralizes power, I believe it will amplify the beneficent aspects of interconnection: a more fair cultural and economic global infrastructure, which provides greater resources and greater opportunities for their access, will in my belief result in unprecedented levels of charity, kindness, and mutual help spreading around throughout the world’s population.” </p><p> We are looking forward to working with Will during the coming year as Shift prepares to disrupt the web and file hosting industries. Will believes that Phantom will be “a breakthrough for blockchain in the marketplace, making Shift the first robustly adopted dApp platform and ecosystem” among the community of regular web developers and traditional businesses.</p>"
